## Another playfull JS Beginner Stuff....

###all pencil drawings I drew on old paper, photographed it , combined it...and then wrote the Javascript Sourcecode...

...of course I did several researches of how I could manage the change of the pics.
And still I have a lot of TODOs , e.g. the background should be wood, some more cards could be seen...
